# what-s-cooking-solution
This repository houses solutions to the "What's Cooking" Kaggle Competition in the form of a Jupyter Notebook file.

The "What's Cooking.ipnyb" File contains solutions using popular machine learning libraries. Run in the same folder as the "train.json" and "test.json" files.

The "kNN with Jaccard Similarity" folder contains an attempt at manually implementing the algorithm. Run data_clean.py followed by knn_test.py in this folder. The code expects the "train.json" and "test.json" files to be present in the "data" folder.

While the competition has ended, the scores received by us as Late Submissions put our top performing models at ranks 17/1338 (SVM) and 39/1338 (Neural Network).
