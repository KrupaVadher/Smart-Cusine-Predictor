# what-s-cooking-solution
This repository houses solutions to the "What's Cooking" Kaggle Competition in the form of a Jupyter Notebook file.

The "What's Cooking.ipnyb" File contains solutions using popular machine learning libraries. Run in the same folder as the "train.json" and "test.json" files.

The "kNN with Jaccard Similarity" folder contains an attempt at manually implementing the algorithm. Run with data_clean.py followed by knn_test.py in this folder, since the code expects the "train.json" and "test.json" files to be present in the "data" folder.
